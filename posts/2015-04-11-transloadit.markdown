[transloadit-yesod](https://github.com/bobjflong/transloadit-yesod) is my first time:

* working with [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/)
* preparing a package using [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/)
* integrating [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/bobjflong/transloadit-yesod) with a Haskell project
* using [lens-aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson)

Integrations tend to have a lot of moving parts. Server side actions; markup; JavaScript; stylesheets. Plugging all of this machinery into your web application is more annoying than it should be. I'm excited by the prospect of using Yesod to build this kind of stuff â™¥
